# Webscraper: Wikipedia notable companies firmographic data
I built this webscraper to collect firmographic data about the companies in the notable companies table for each country contained in the [Wikipedia list of companies by country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_companies_by_country). This data is then used on my Syntethic Data Generator to generate fake prospects from these companies for testing purposes.
